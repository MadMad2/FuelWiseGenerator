## Core Features:

- Hour Input: Input operating hours for each diesel generator unit based on scheduled and on-demand usage.
- Fuel Rate Configuration: Configure fuel consumption rates specific to each of the three diesel generator units.
- Consumption Calculation: Calculate the fuel consumption in liters for each generator, based on inputted hours and fuel rates.
- Usage Breakdown: Provide a breakdown of fuel consumption based on scheduled vs. on-demand usage for each generator.
- Fuel Level Tracking: Track and display the remaining fuel level in each generator's fuel tank/storage.
- Expense Input: Include fields to add supplementary expenses like transportation (переезд), maintenance (МВГ), and component replacement (АМКП).
- Cost Estimation: Calculate overall fuel costs per generator (based on consumption), fuel remaining, and accounting of extra expense costs like transportation and maintenance.
